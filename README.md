Simple fix for Gumtree tiny images. 

Since the Gumtree updated for some users (including me) it has been hard to see the pictures in the slideshows. For some reason they have been re-sized to small thumbnails even if they are in good resolution. 

So as a quick fix I wrote this simple JS hack, that you can run on the side and make the images nice and big.

You have two options:

1. Open your JS console (*ctrl+shift+c* on firefox, *ctrl+shift+j* on chrome) and paste the code in to the console
2. Download *Greasemonkey* browser extension and make the code run automatically on gumtree page

Enjoy!
